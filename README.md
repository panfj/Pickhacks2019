# Making the Chains
Nutrition is a large contributor to the physical development of athletes. To continue to perform, athletes are not only required to consume a large amount of food but also the right type of food. Because of this, it may be difficult for aspiring athletes to keep track of their caloric intake or have a track to follow in their pursuit to fame. Making the Chains is made for this very reason, pushing younger athletes to eat like professionals with personalized nutritional plans, the website is the beginning of a player's road to stardom.
